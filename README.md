# vMenu (modded version by dotexe)

This is a vMenu mod for drift/freeroam servers. From the original vMenu, mine adds custom header image support for all menus, client-side time & weather, saved vehicles & vehicle spawner for addon cars (with custom categories) using a JSON config, teleport locations menu using a JSON config, RGB vehicle colors, and a custom about menu.
